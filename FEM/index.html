            <h1 class=story-quarter>A Biking Genius in the Making!</h1>
            <p class="article-text">A local El Segundo boy, Ezio YunBaldi, just turned four and has taken up cycling.
                His parents were orignially uneasy with the boy's deciscion to take to two wheels; what if he were to
                face-plant?
                He's got such a beautiful face and his mother cringed at the ideal of a face infestation of scabs!
                Nonetheless of their fears, the family
                took to the Polliwog Park Ampitheater, where Ezio did everything BUT face-plant! The boy, as it turns
                out, is a phenom. His ability to
                control his speed and climb are mind boggling. All eyes will be on him during his upcoming Tour de
                France endeavours.</p>

                Malaysian/Lebanese girlfriends who was
                driving illegaly? Nevermind that! The important part is that we are all kept apprised of his
